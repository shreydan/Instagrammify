# Instagrammify
Convert your landscape/portrait pictures into a square image without losing content.

`You might think it's dumb since Instagram already allows original aspect ratio upload for photos
but this was exclusively created for group uploads because option to do that is not available yet.
Hence, I also provided you the option to type in multiple image paths together and get it done ASAP!`

## How to use:

 * REQUIREMENTS: install Pillow image module via pip:  `pip install Pillow`
 * Run `instagrammify.py`
 * Punch in `no. of images` you want to convert.
 * Type in the `PATH` of the image(s) you want to convert.
 * It will do everything else for you.
